# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data(Top 50 songs in 2021) from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--Who are the top 5 most tracks in 2021 and what are their dacnceability?
SELECT track_name, danceability,popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5

----Which artists have more than 2 of their songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(artist_name)>2
ORDER BY count(artist_name)desc


----Calculate artists who have an average popularity of 90 or above.
WITH temptable AS (SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity)as average_popularity
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 
FROM temptable
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
